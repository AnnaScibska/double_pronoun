			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
			<p>I am very junior web developer and french learner. Page was created primarly for training my yet doubtful :) programming skills and for learning some french as a second goal. That is to say struggling with my frustration in the uneven fight with french grammar.</p>
			<p>Gradually i am going to add some new features to the website. Feel free to use it if you think you might use some french grammar exercises.</p>
			<p>At the moment page works properly only in Chrome and is not yet responsive. But I am working on it. So stay tuned :)</p>
